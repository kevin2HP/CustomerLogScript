# CustomerLogScript
This code takes User input, specifically the first and last name and saves it to a list 
This script also asigns a id to the Users input  
This script was made with the idea of automating a customer log book
Instead of manually saving customer Data this script will not only
save the save the data but also create a folder for each customer
and give each customer their own unique Id making indexing much easier
